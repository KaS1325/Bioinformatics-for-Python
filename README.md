# Bioinformatics with Python: A Personal Learning Repository

This repository documents my learning journey in **Bioinformatics using Python**, with a focus on leveraging **free and open-source tools** available to the global scientific community. The goal is to build foundational knowledge through practical coding exercises, problem-solving, and tool development.

All work in this repository is inspired by the [rebelScience YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/@rebelscience) and problems from the [Rosalind platform](https://rosalind.info), both of which offer accessible yet conceptually rich bioinformatics challenges.
